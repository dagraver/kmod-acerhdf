ACERHDF(4)             FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual             ACERHDF(4)

NAME
     acerhdf -- Acer Aspire One fan control

DESCRIPTION
     The acerhdf driver allows you to control the fans of some of the Acer
     Aspire One netbook models, so that they are not constantly running.
     Other netbooks might be supported as well.  See SUPPORTED DEVICES for
     more details.  It is a port of the Linux kernel module with the same
     name.

     acerhdf monitors the system temperature and turns the fan on if it is
     above the fan-on threshold, and turns it off again if the temperature
     drops below the fan-off threshold.

SYSCTL VARIABLES
     dev.acerhdf.0.enabled
             Set to 1, if acerhdf should start controlling the fan.  Defaults
             to 0, which means acerhdf is not in control of the fan.

     dev.acerhdf.0.fanon
             The temperature at which the fan should be turned on.  Defaults
             to 60.

     dev.acerhdf.0.fanoff
             The temperature at which the fan should be turned off again.
             Defaults to 53.

     dev.acerhdf.0.fanstate
             Read-only.  Returns the current fan state, auto if the fan is
             running or off.

     dev.acerhdf.0.interval
             Seconds to wait between temperature polls.  Defaults to 5
             seconds.

     dev.acerhdf.0.temperature
             Read-only.  The current system temperature in degree Celsius.

SUPPORTED DEVICES
     acerhdf was tested on an Acer Aspire One A150 running FreeBSD 10.1.  The
     FreeBSD port will most likely support the same range of devices as the
     original Linux version.  Support also depends on the BIOS version of your
     computer.  Please refer to the source code for the BIOS versions that are
     supported for your particular device.

     To determine your BIOS version run:

           kenv smbios.bios.version

EXAMPLES
     To enable acerhdf make sure it is installed in /boot/modules and add the
     following settings to your /boot/loader.conf:

           acerhdf_load="YES"

     and your /etc/sysctl.conf:

           dev.acerhdf.0.enabled=1

     You may want to adjust the fan-on and fan-off thresholds as well.
